## Epilogue

With this document, I have written a 6 months long journey at RevoU to study many aspects of Software Development, mainly to become a Fullstack Developer. My journey here is not done yet, in fact, it open a broader and wider oppurtunity to explore. The things that inspire me is to create an automated systems that integrated technology, AI, and Human touch to enhance human being both as a unique individual, but as a community as a whole. The purpose of this system later on is to give Human much opportunity to enjoy life with maximum satisfaction possible. The goal is achieved when we as a human, no longer needs to sacrifice so much of our time to do repetitive and menial tasks, as well as dangerous and risky tasks just in order to survive dailly needs. With this clear goal in mind, there will be long tough road ahead of me. Alas, by completeion of this documentation, I can proudly said that the first step has been completed successfully. And I hope my future projects will find you well, and be able to contribute much to you and the community. - [FIN] -
